## At the EthCC conference

Slack will be the best tool:

* if you missed the invite, use the email address you registered with to get access to [https://ethcc.slack.com](https://ethcc.slack.com)
* do not just stay in the general channel, browse the different channels to find topics of your interest.  
  If you want to hook up around a specific topic, create a channel of your own, though check first to avoid duplicates. ![](/assets/priv-speakers | EthCC Slack 2018-03-05 21-48-58.png)
